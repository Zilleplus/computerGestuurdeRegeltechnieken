\section{Conclusions}
The main conclusion is that controlling a system is making choices. You have to specify what is the desired controller and keep in mind that the ideal controller probably don't exist. A second conclusion is that velocity states can be estimated with position states and therefore some sensors can be eliminated in price sensitive applications. But you have to always keep in mind that the states will be contaminated with noise and it is also a lesson to design a set-up with a high signal-to-noise ratio, low noise sensitivity.
