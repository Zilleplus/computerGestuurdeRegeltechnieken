\section{Intro}
The goal of this practical session is to stabilize a rotary inverted pendulum witch is of unstable nature. Further we will investigate the effect of some design parameters on the controller. In the first stadium, Simulink is used for tuning the controller. In a next stadium the practical set-up is used to verify the Simulink model and to gain some practical experience.

The appendix contains a brief description of how to use the matlab files to redo the simulated experiments.
